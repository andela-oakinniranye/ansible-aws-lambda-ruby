[Traveling Ruby](http://phusion.github.io/traveling-ruby/) is used to include the Ruby runtime in the package.\r\n\r\n[The Ansible AWS Lambda module is not yet included in core](https://github.com/ansible/ansible-modules-extras/pull/1270), so for now it must be present in any playbook that uses this role. [Here is an example playbook I used to test this role](https://github.com/krautcomputing/ansible-aws-lambda-ruby-test).\r\n\r\nI sure hope AWS Lambda supports Ruby natively soon!\r\n\r\n## Acknowledgements\r\n\r\nThis code based on the projects of [qrush](https://github.com/qrush) and [lorennorman](https://github.com/lorennorman) who did the bulk of the work:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/qrush/lambda-function-wrapper-ruby\r\n* https://github.com/lorennorman/ruby-on-lambda\r\n\r\nI simply took the Shell scripts they wrote and packaged them up in an Ansible role since this is what I like to use to automate stuff.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
